# Algorithms
Algorithms are very important in computer Science. The best chosen algorithm makes sure computer will do the given task at best possible manner. In cases where efficiency matter a proper algorithm is really vital to be used. An algorithm is important in optimizing a computer program according to the available resources.  .

Ultimately when anyone decide to solve a problem through better algorithms then searching for  the best combination of program speed and least amount of memory consumption is desired. 

## Types Of Algorithms : 

  ### - Brute force
Brute force algorithm emphasis on solving problems in the most straight forward manner. It implies to use basic techniques to solve problems. In short these are simplest algorithms to be used. The simplicity costs in speed as this algorithm is comparatively slow in generating results. The best way is to use it with problems those are having small input size.

  ### - Divide and conquer

The basic idea of this method is to make programs based on dividing the size of problems. In each loop cut the problem in parts with constant factor and then process further in the same fashion. This is a fast algorithm.
